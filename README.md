# test-utils
This framework makes writing UI tests much more easier and cheaper.
Framework is based on selenium wrappers and principles which canopy uses. 
Use functions CheckIf... to write your acceptations tests. Do not care about Assert class.

CheckIf... functions throws meaningful exceptions. The exceptions usualy contains informations about css selector of element, expected value and provided value etc.
